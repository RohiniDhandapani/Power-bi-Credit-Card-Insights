# Power-bi-Credit-Card-Launch-Insights

## 🏦 Domain: Banking | 🎯 Function: Strategy

This project simulates a real-world pilot analysis for Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. The bank aimed to launch a new line of credit cards and provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities to evaluate customer spending behavior and guide strategic product planning.

As part of this independent data challenge, I analyzed the dataset using Power BI to simulate a real-world business case scenario. The insights and recommendations presented here are tailored to support Mitron Bank's product strategy and marketing decisions.
